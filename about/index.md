I love working with the latest technologies, espeically those that relate to data products. I believe in implementing simple solutions with minimal maintenance through test automation and eloquent designs. My software experience spans the full stack; from system level deployment to application implementation. In particular: 

* Apache Spark
* Ansible
* Amazon Web Services (Kinesis, Redshift, S3, EC2, Route53, VPC)
* Scala / Java   
* Cassandra
* MongoDB

## Professional highlights

* Implemented a high-throughput data pipeline that enabled massive amounts of data to be published to _AWS Kinesis_ and consumed with _Apache Spark_. The infrastructure enabled in-flight computation as well as data integration with a variety of datastores.  
* Built a highly scalable analytics reporting system as part of the core product of our software as a service (SaaS) platform. The system was designed using a services oriented architecture (SOA) model to minimize coupling. It also supported horizontal scaling by distributing writes and reads across nodes. Over a million data points can be processed within minutes and rendered within seconds to the end user. 
* Architected as well as implemented a new configuration management system for the core QP platform at [QuickMobile](http://quickmobile.com). The design decoupled the system services from the application to enable greater flexibility and reduced down-down during deployments. The configuration mechanism was implemented using Ansible in idempotent style.
* Automated the deployment and buildup of an AWS cloud infrastructure that auto-scales with traffic demand. The infrastructure was automated using Ansible and enabled the deployment of multi-instance clusters with varying configuration.
